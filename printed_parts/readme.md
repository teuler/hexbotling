For [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org/)-code files, see [here](https://github.com/teuler/hexbotling/tree/main/printed_parts/openscad_files)).

- `body_frame_v1.stl` - Frame of the robot, to which the legs are attached.
- `leg_coxa_femur_v1.stl` - Servo holder, which serves as base element for _coxa_ and _femur_. Note that the servo holder for the _coxa_ is integrated into the robot's frame
- `leg_link_bottom_v1.stl` - Bottom half of the clamp that connectes leg parts.
- `leg_link_top_v1.stl` - Top half of the clamp that connectes leg parts.
- `leg_tibia_tarsus_v1a.stl` - _Tibia_ and _tarsus_ in one piece (2DOF), so basically the "foot".
- `stand_v1.stl` - Stand to mount the robot on while calibrating/testing the leg movements.
