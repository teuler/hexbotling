# Hexbotling

Hexbotling is a robotic project in progress. The goal is a relatively small and simple, 3D printed walking robot with 6 legs and 2 degrees-of-freedom (2DOF) each. Instead of documenting a finished project, I will show the development. 

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/teuler/hexbotling/wiki) for details and videos.
